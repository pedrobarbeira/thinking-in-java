Solutions to the exercises of Thinking In Java by Bruce Eckel

As of now, this repository is quite deorganized. I'll try and find time in the near future to provide a better organization for the exercises of each chapter. 

Getting through the book is quite the task - there are many exercises, and the book itself is quite long, with over 1000 pages. It was a personal decision
to go through it fully, solving every exercise along the way. Think of it as a strategy to cultivate a completionist mindset.

As of now, most chapters have incomplete solutions. This is due to two reasons. The first is that I tend to reach chapters "front-to-back", only stopping at 
the end. Since the exercises are interwined with the theory, eventually comes a point where I'm either too tired to solve more exercises, or have to skip them
due to time constraints. At first this felt like cheating, but I later concluded it could actually be a smart move. From this conclusion arises the second
reason: skipping those exercises allows me to solve them after I read the book, providing a chance to reiterate through the contents with a more expanded 
perspective and understanding.

It's the first time I'm deliberatly employing this strategy. In the problem-solving-with-cpp repository the method was to solve every single chapter exercise
before moving on to the next chapter. This eventually lead to loss of motivation - it's quite boring to go through 20 array problems before learning a new 
topic. It also doesn't feel very productive or educational. So for Thinking In Java I decided to take this approach: solve as many exercises as I can while
reading each chapter, and upon reaching the point of saturation simply move forward, leaving those left to be solved after finishing the book's contents.

Hopefully this repository will provide some help and guidance to someone somewhere who isn't quite sure how to solve something. If it doesn't, it's still
a fun thing to do. A track record for my learning process.
